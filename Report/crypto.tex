\section{A short note on cryptography}

The project described in this report relies heavily on cryptographic system and practices in order to be possible. It is however the case that none of the persons working on the project have any previous experiences working with secure systems, since we come from backgrounds in algorithms and computer graphics. We have chosen such a heavy reliance on systems outside our normal line of work as a learning experience, and with the strong conviction that most cryptographic systems work well as black boxes.

Expanding further on this, when we refer to a cryptographic method, we will rarely expand on the inner workings of such components, but rather rely on their security as provided by their developers. Of course this makes us somewhat prone to making errors that would be considered mistakes by hardened security veterans, but we beg forgiveness for our bright-eyed naïveté. 

In the end, what matters to us in this project, is the parts that relate to peer-to-peer systems.
