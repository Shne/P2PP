\section{Experiments}
We have performed several experiments on our system, both to show that our security measures work, to find optimal parameters and to compare flooding and k-walker approaches with our added security features.

\subsection{Finding optimal k-walker parameters}
As described in section~\ref{subsec:base_system}, the k-walker algorithm implements an eventual delivery guarantee as long as sender remains connected to the network by sending out walkers with exponentially increasing TTL at exponentially increasing intervals. Before doing the experiments comparing flooding and k-walkers we needed to find some optimal or at least pretty good parameters for this.

The required parameters were the starting values of wait time and TTL as well as how many walkers to send in parallel each time. Tested values of starting wait time include 0.5, 1, 2, and tested starting values of TTL include 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and the tested numbers of walkers to send out time include 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. Since each test took quite a while and had to be repeated several times to try different network layouts, we didn't test all possible combinations of the values but used our intuition and understanding of the effect of the values to zero in on some good values to test further. We found that the network layout had a huge effect on the time and number of passed messages in the network to send a single message and receive verification of delivery. We omit presenting the data from this experiments as not even close to every combination of the parameters were tested, making graphing the values useless, and not every test was written down.


\subsection{Flooding vs. k-walkers}
We tested the time and internal messages passed in the whole network by having two peers join a network of varying sizes and sending 10 messages from one to another, waiting for the acknowledgement of the previous message before sending the next. This test was then repeated to test various network layouts. These tests were performed with Proof-of-Work turned off and no artificial latency introduced in the system.

We weren't able to have networks involving more than 230 or so peers running on the same machine without random peers dying or at least not responding fast enough so we limit our testing to a max network size of 200.

(TODO: Fejlen er fixet. 2 tests, 1 der sammenligner beskeder, og 1 der sammenligner latency)
