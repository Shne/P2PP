\section{Introduction}
With the recent rise in awareness about the blanket surveillance of our daily internet usage, the general population no longer feel that the anonymity and security of their online exchanges are guaranteed. We hope to amend this. 

In this project report, we describe how to develop a peer to peer system that allows the exchange of  encrypted chat messages, while making it quite difficult to determine who sent and received what messages.
The system is built on top of an existing unstructured network, and the techniques we use could be applied to many different unstructured networks. This means, that with minor extensions, existing networks can be allowed to support this kind of traffic.
We will describe both why we have chosen to develop this system, how it works, how to operate it, and show experiments that measure the performance of the network.
