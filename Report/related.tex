Protecting freedom of speech and the free exchange of ideas in the face of government oppression and censorship is one of the nobler goals of P2P networks and cryptography. Several systems and protocols with this as their main goal have been designed and analysed over the years. One such project is Freenet~\citep{freenet} which builds a virtual file space distributed among peers and provides censorship resistance by being anonymous, decentralized, encrypted with peers only knowing about direct neighbours, and providing peers plausible deniability by having the shared resources be encrypted so forwarding peers can't know the content. Freenet, however, provides very low performance and no guarantee that a file will remain, as replication relies on the resource being requested by other peers and other peers choosing to cache it along the way. Resources are also available to anyone, meaning encryption of shared resources and another channel to distribute the keys is paramount. Resources also cannot be sent to a specific target. 

A different system that provides something closer to a real-time instant message client is BitMessage\citep{bitmessage}. This, however, uses flooding to send messages across the network and as we have demonstrated in our previous paper~\citep{P2PN}, there are better performing alternatives, such as random k-walkers, and we would like to see if we could implement something as secure as BitMessage using these different methods of sending messages.
